# DECA-EIB
EIB Draft for DECA
If you want to specify bold, italic, etc. use MARKDOWN. Here is a quick list:

Italic: surrond word with underscores. Ex. \_test\_ would be _test_  

Bold: surrond word with two asterisks. Ex. \**test\** would be **test**

Titles and subtitles:
Put a pound sign(\#) in front of the line with a space after. The more pound signs you add, the smaller the text will be.

# One pound
## Two pound
### Three pound
#### Four pound
